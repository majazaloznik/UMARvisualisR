\description{
A bit of an eclectic function, but there's no way around it. This funciton
creates a blind plot to get the user dimensions
of the final chart, which lets it wrap the title, which lets it get the number
of lines for the title, which along with the number of lines in the legend
and a few graphical parameters lets us know what the top margin has to be.
Also returns the position of the title in lines and the wrapped title.
